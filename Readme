Artist Statement :
Recorded video is inherently a time based media, this app seeks to subvert that notion by exploring diffrernt ways to play back viideo.
The methods used inside this app center around playing videos back in a non linear fashion. By allowing you to jump to random frame and control playback speed, video can become non-linear.
Due to this fact the video codecs used to achive this are not exactly standard ( dont try it with H.264 based media ) and all video files must be encoded with codecs that will store every frame .
( Photo Jpeg / DXV / HAP ) are the best codecs to use.
